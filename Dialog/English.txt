Hiya! What are you doing here?
[MADELINE left surprised]
Hi, little kitty cat! What's your name?
[PERCY right posing]
Great question!
You have the honor of talking to {~}{#decba0}Percy the Nimble{#}{/~}, the great explorer of the wilds and conqueror of scary mountain peaks!
[PERCY right curious]
So what are you doing here? Did you come to try my obstacle course?
[MADELINE left normal]
I'll just call you Percy, little kitty. I'm {#f94a4a}{savedata Name}{#}!
I was hiking around, just sort of exploring the area. Is the obstacle course something you made?
[PERCY right curious]
Yeah! I made it to practice climbing, it's an entire trail!
You should try it, I bet you're gonna like it!
[MADELINE left sad]
I don't know, I'm not that great at acrobatic stuff, I just like to hike.
[MADELINE left determined]
I guess I can try, little Percy!
[MADELINE left peaceful]
You're so cute that I can't refuse.

Oh hi! You must've gotten here through my obstacle course!
[MADELINE left surprised]
Hi, little kitty cat! What's your name?
[PERCY right posing]
Great question!
You have the honor of talking to {~}{#decba0}Percy the Nimble{#}{/~}, the great explorer of the wilds and conqueror of scary mountain peaks!
[PERCY right focused]
You must be a great climber if you got this far into my course.
[MADELINE left sad]
Well, I guess I'm not the worst, little Percy. I'm {#f94a4a}{savedata Name}{#}, by the way.
[MADELINE left normal]
It's a great course! I had been hiking in this mountain forest when I came across it, and it's been really fun so far!
[PERCY right curious]
Thank you so much! I worked really hard on it.
It's weird that I missed you at the trailhead, I was just there.
I guess you're that fast...
[MADELINE left determined]
People tell me I'm pretty stealthy, maybe you just didn't notice me.
[PERCY right curious]
Wow, that's cool! I want to be as stealthy as you are.
Anyway, good luck!
For this next section I just recently got some {#2c9dc9}"parachutes"{#}.
I hope you like it!
[MADELINE left surprised]
{#2c9dc9}Parachutes{#}???
[PERCY right sassy]
Don't worry, they're fun and you're definitely up for it.
[PERCY right curious]
Well, the next room is a bit funny, but I believe in you!


FWGSSC_ravenJB_Percy2_dialog=
[PERCY right nosy]
Hey, you got through!
I watched you, you were great!
[PERCY right curious]
How are you so good at climbing?
[MADELINE left sad]
Yeah, I've actually done a bit of climbing in my free time.
[MADELINE left normal]
I just thought it could be fun to trick you.
[PERCY right nosy]
Oh wow, you're good. I didn't even realize you were tricking me.
[PERCY right normal]
Anyway, for this next section I just recently got some {#2c9dc9}"parachutes"{#}.
I hope you like it!

{#989898}... maybe i shouldn't have opened this room to the public yet, its so sketchy ...{#}
[PERCY right normal]
Oh, you're still here?
When you get to the end, try to find my secret hiding spot!
It's right past the orange heart that marks the finish line - I'll be there.

FWGSSC_ravenJB_Percy3_intro=
[PERCY right focused]
Oh! You scared me... No one usually finds my secret spot.
[PERCY right normal]
I'm {~}{#decba0}Percy{#}{/~}. Did you get here through my obstacle course?
[MADELINE left sad]
Hi, little kitty, I'm {#f94a4a}{savedata Name}{#}. Sorry for breaking into your secret place, I was just curious what's here.
[PERCY right curious]
Don't worry! Only a great climber would be able to get through my entire course!
Did you enjoy it?
[MADELINE left sad]
Well, to be honest, some spots could use a little polish... or a lot, even.
[MADELINE left normal]
But I think I enjoyed it! You're a talented builder, little Percy!
[PERCY right nosy]
Thank you, {#f94a4a}Ms\. {savedata Name}{#}! I worked really hard on it.
...{1.2} You're amazing, you know that?
[MADELINE left peaceful]
Aww, thank you, cutie.
You're also amazing!

FWGSSC_ravenJB_Percy3_dialog=
[PERCY right normal]
Oh, you got here!
This place is actually pretty hard to find, I didn't expect you to do it.
[MADELINE left normal]
Yeah, this was definitely tricky, but I'm used to difficulty.
The air is so fresh here. I guess we're pretty high up at this point?
[PERCY right posing]
Yeah, and isn't the view awesome?
[MADELINE left normal]
It's gorgeous, little Percy. You should be proud for building all this on your own.
[PERCY right curious]
Did you enjoy the course?
[MADELINE left normal]
Yeah, I think I enjoyed it a lot! You're a talented builder, little Percy!
[PERCY right nosy]
Thank you, {#f94a4a}Ms\. {savedata Name}{#}! I worked really hard on it.
...{1.2} You're amazing, you know that?
[MADELINE left peaceful]
Aww, thank you, cutie.
You're also amazing!

FWGSSC_ravenJB_Percy3_repeat=
[PERCY right focused]
I guess I gotta go. My {~}{#decba0}mom{#}{/~} is probably getting worried by now.
[MADELINE left normal]
Do you live somewhere nearby?
[PERCY right normal]
Yeah, we live in a house right on the edge of town. It's probably where you came from to get here.
[MADELINE left distracted]
I shouldn't keep your mom waiting then.
[MADELINE left normal]
Say hello to her for me! She should be proud for raising such an awesome little kitty cat.
[PERCY right lazy]
Will do! Bye!

The sign is worn and rusted, however you can make out the faint text through the rain.
{center}- WELCOME TO POINTGATE CITY -{center}

This city must have been abandoned decades ago...{n}{0.5}I wonder what happened to it...

# Onyx ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FWGSSC_Cookie_Text0=
[MADELINE left distracted]
There seems to be something written on the wall...

[MADELINE left sad]
It seems to be a message from another adventurer.

[]
{big}Day ???{/big}
This is a warning to anyone who reads this.
The entrance was barricaded for a reason. Do not go any further unless you are truly confident in your climbing abilities.
These caves messed me up pretty bad when I fell. It's a miracle I'm alive to write this message.

[MADELINE left sad]
That's... not ominous in the slightest...

[MADELINE left distracted]
I hope I can handle this.

[]
If for some reason you want to press on anyway, do so cautiously. These caves have a strange power to them, and things don't seem to act the way they should.

[MADELINE left sad]
I've noticed already. Something definitely feels... different... about my dash.
It's scary, not understanding how it works anymore.
...

[MADELINE left distracted]
Take a deep breath, you'll be okay.

[MADELINE left sad]
…



FWGSSC_Cookie_Text1=
[]
{big}Day 1{/big}
I have finally built up the courage to enter these mines.
This used to be a very busy mining site, due to its incredible mineral density. Project Onyx it was called.
Several years ago though, there was a fatal accident here and the mine was shut down suddenly.
Over time, the neatly-arranged shafts fell into disrepair and the project slowly faded into obscurity.

[MADELINE left sad]
…

[]
This seems like a fine spot to rest for today, while I prepare myself for the long expedition ahead.



FWGSSC_Cookie_Text2=
[]
{big}Day 2{/big}
This stretch is particularly difficult, so I thought I'd offer assistance to anyone else who has made it this far.
See those hanging support beams?
If you approach one of those with a {*}lot of speed{/*}, and jump off it at just the right time, you can go flying!

[MADELINE left normal]
Hey, this seems fun!

[MADELINE left distracted]
I hope I don't fall...



FWGSSC_Cookie_Text3=
[]
{big}Day 3{/big}
It's been getting steadily more difficult to keep track of the time ever since my watch has died. It might be Day 4 by now.
I've now reached the deeper part of the mine, where the bulk of the minerals can be found.
The air is getting pretty hot in here though, and magma flows freely mere feet below me. It's becoming dangerous just to walk around.
To make matters worse, these grappling hooks are a nuisance to use. At least someone was kind enough to mark out the best locations to use them from.
It seems like you get a different launch trajectory if you are jumping when the grappling hook begins to pull you in.
Perhaps this technique could help me travel deeper.

[MADELINE left normal]
So if I {*}grab{/*} the wall with one of these hooks, then {*}jump{/*}, I can get launched...?

FWGSSC_Cookie_Text4=
[]
{big}Day... 5?{/big}
Disaster has struck. One hook misfire is all it took to shatter my hopes for a prosperous future.
As much as it disappoints me to say this, my time as an adventurer is over. When I escape, I'll be all but guaranteed to be wheelchair-bound forever.
{*}If{/*} I escape, that is.

Well I wish you'd make up your mind, but fine.

SECRET_CHOICE_LOOP_RESPONSE_ONE=
[MADELINE left normal]
I thought there were way too many loop blocks!
[SECRET_CHARACTER]
Well now. That's quite rude of you.
As it turns out though, I do have an extra special loop block-less room.
I'll go ahead and send you there now!

SECRET_CHOICE_LOOP_RESPONSE_TWO=

Well. Back to the loop-less room for you I guess. Have fun.

[MADELINE left normal]
I thought there were way too many zippers!

Hey. That's rude. I really like zippers.

Maybe you'll enjoy it. It's only loop blocks and boosters.
Off you go!

[MADELINE left normal]
I thought there were way too many boosters!
[SECRET_CHARACTER]
Hmm you might not want to stick with that one.
I mean yeah some of the boosters are a little redundant.
But they're so handy for readability and execution.
But if you insist...
I did make a special room with none of those silly bubbles.
Good luck!

I loved Buffy being in the map!
[SECRET_CHARACTER]
Oh yeah we don't get an enormous amount of free will here.
I'm glad you liked Buffy though!

So if you want any advice come over to me!

HINT_ACTUAL=
[SECRET_CHARACTER]
Hi again!
Remember: this is a bit of a hint for the room.
My NDA lets me give a little bit of advice, but I know some people want to figure things out themselves so...
If you don't want anything you should go ahead and skip this. I'm always here if you want to know later.

[PETER right flip normal]
Actually, I'm Pink Peter... Of the Peter Cartel.
I've been staying round Yellow Peter's house lately and the washing machine is broken and it's a whole thing...
I can appreciate the confusion.
Anyways, I can't let you go any further! The fate of our empire of glorious white powder is at stake!

FWGSSC_Spooooky_PeterYellow5=

The name is Peter of the Peter Cartel.

FWGSSC_Spooooky_PeterBlack4=

Shocker.

FWGSSC_Spooooky_PeterBlack5=
[PETER right flip normal]
No but like actually Peter.

Did you know he is the CEO of his own company?
He is the most successful snow merchant in the country!

[MADELINE left surprised]
Snow?! That's what they mean by "glorious white powder"?

[GRANNY right mock]
Yes, dear, the finest, fluffiest snow you can buy!
What else could it be?

[MADELINE left determined]
I assumed it was.. uhh.. nevermind...

[MADELINE left upset]
Who is buying snow? It literally falls from the sky.
